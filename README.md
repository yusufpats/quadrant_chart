A flutter application showing the usage of simple `CustomPaint` and `CustomPainter` to draw a quadrant chart with dynamically populated data (icons) inside each quadrant.

The `CustomPaint` allows you to draw any complex UI using elemental shapes like circles, arc, lines, path, etc

#### `CustomPaint` widget
```
CustomPaint(
   painter: ChartPainter(),
   child: Container(),
 )
```

#### `ChartPainter` class
```
class ChartPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
     // TODO: start painting shapes here
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true;
  }
}
```
